Because this file's name does not start with numbers, it will be ignored by `publish.py`; i.e., it will not count as a chapter.

Its contents, however, can still be included by using the following notation: `<+[example.md]+>`.

In fact, one can also choose specific lines from this file to be included, rather than the entire file.  
See "Including specific lines from files" in `00_intro.md` for details.
